    <h1>Dashboard Summary</h1>

    <div class="summary-container">
        <div class="filter-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Filtering Capabilities</h2>
            <p>The dashboard provides robust filtering capabilities to analyze benchmark results effectively. Users can refine their view based on specific criteria:</p>

            <div class="filter-item">
                <span class="filter-label">Date Range:</span>
                <p>Allowing the user to select a start and end date. This enables time-based analysis and trend identification. Users can analyze performance over specific periods, such as daily, weekly, or monthly comparisons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="filter-item">
                <span class="filter-label">Run ID:</span>
                <p>Filter results based on specific Run IDs, which represent unique identifiers for each benchmark run. This allows for isolating and comparing the performance of individual runs. Users can analyze specific runs in detail or compare different runs to understand the impact of configuration changes or other factors.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="filter-item">
                <span class="filter-label">Index Type:</span>
                <p>Filter by the type of vector index used (e.g., HNSW, IVF, etc.). This allows for a direct comparison of different indexing algorithms and their performance characteristics. Users can assess which index type is most suitable for their specific data and query patterns. It also allows for isolation of tests that utilize specific index parameters.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="data-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Charts</h2>
            <p>The dashboard currently visualizes key performance indicators through a single image containing four primary charts:</p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <p>This image displays the following metrics: QPS (Queries Per Second), Latency p50 (50th Percentile Latency), Latency p95 (95th Percentile Latency), and Index Build Time.</p>
                <iframe width="1200" height="1000" src="https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/reporting/aa12e1e1-9c45-4208-8aa8-39d53759988e/page/DYHcE" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>These charts, combined with the filtering options, allow users to analyze performance trends, identify bottlenecks, and optimize their vector search configurations effectively. The filtering allows the user to view the charts based on date range, Run ID, and index type.</p>
